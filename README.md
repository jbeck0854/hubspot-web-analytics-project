# HubSpot Web Analytics Project
Web Analytics project analyzing HubSpot customer behavior, customer &amp; revenue churn, forecasting, and sentiment analysis, incorporating R and Excel.

## Project Overview

This project evaluates customer behavior and revenue dynamics for a CRM SaaS business, such as HubSpot, using web analytics and customer data. The analysis focuses on understanding churn drivers, forecasting future performance, and extracting sentiment insights from user-generated content to inform data-driven business decisions.

## Key Questions

- What patterns and trends are observable in customer and revenue churn?
- Can historical data, extracted from Financial Statements, Consumer Reports, and Web Tracking sites, be used to forecast future performance and transform digital strategy?
- What sentiment signals emerge from customer discussions and reviews?
- How can these insights inform retention and growth strategies?

## Data & Supporting Materials
