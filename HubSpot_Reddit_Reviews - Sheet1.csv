"""I’ve been a loyal HubSpot user and advocate for over a decade, but lately, I’ve been disappointed. The customer service has noticeably declined, and features that were once included in our plan are now locked behind higher paywalls. It’s frustrating to see core functionality get gated after years of being available."""
"""Marketing ops/revops career long fella here. Hubspot CRM over everything for b2b companies. Hubspot now pulls weight in terms of customizing the UI, creating it to fit the mold of your business vs. forcing your biz to adapt to an out of box setup. I’ve used hs for over a decade and let me tell you, it’s gotten so much better. No need for hs<>salesforce for full commercial teams. Hubspot is expensive, yes, but at what cost? How much more expensive is it to have a shitty crm or duplicate tools that don’t fit business needs but were bought for cost savings instead? The reality is you NEED an ops person who knows hubspot or any crm to have a proper commercial strategy. Businesses that don’t do this really need to reprioritize. For ops folks, it’s not just good enough to know the basics of a platform. You need to be creative, learn how to map tech to business needs, learn how to build integrations that connect to core user databases, grasp basic various schemas, etc. You think hubspot is complicated? 8 years ago deals didn’t even exist. Nor did custom objects, nor did a lot of really incredible marketing features like CTAs, the email interface, etc. Hubspot doesn’t work for some folks because they buy the marketing of the product thinking it will be a game changer. Rather, people should deeply understand their requirements and scope of buying a product before moving forward. No tech or tool will truly make a difference if you buy it with the hope alone that it will make an impact. Business requires deep thinking and strategy, not just buying a tool because you think it will help."""
"""Yeah I've seen so many features get pushed to premium subscription, limited functionalities, on the flip side opportunity for Hubspot developers to capitalize on that missing spot. e.g Bulk Duplicate action. Hubspot CMS is something I find very limiting."""
"""Prepare to be flooded in dms by shite partners who've never worked in real businesses, only agency world."""
"""In my experience there are very little HubSpot workarounds that CANT be completed with a Zapier Pro account, and a good developer."""
"""I too hate hubspot. But I don't decide its purchase. I hate the price, the UI, the reps, they are rude and they just want to sell. Zoho is the ultimate solution to Hubspot."""
"""Can I ask when HubSpot changed the email workflow to be a column down the side? I just spent 30 mins trying to figure out how to schedule an email. It used to be part of the steps across the top... why would you make it a column down the side? Sorry for venting, but all change is not good change."""
"""My sales agents were complaining every day this week about the lag time in loading different pages and tools. Every day… I kept telling them to restart their computers and clear their cache because I didn’t know what else to tell them."""
"""Zoho + zapier will do 90% of it. Plus there are so many basic, basic gaps in HubSpot’s reporting and contact rotation that it creates more problems than it solves. We’ve moved away from it completely."""
"""Worst CRM you could have. Unusable… load times for every click and barely loads correctly no matter the device."""
"""Is HubSpot a good CRM? (full disclosure, I'm a HubSpot Partner Agency). I would say HubSpot is an excellent CRM for most people. However it certainly comes down to what your needs/wants/budget would be for a CRM. At face value the CRM is free, which is pretty cool for a business who just needs a place to store their contacts for reference or note taking. But you'll likely want to be able to email them or setup sales pipelines and that's where costs start to come in. HubSpot has made these costs a lot more scalable for small businesses, which is nice. Having extensively used Salesforce (which is absolute garbage), I can confidently say that HubSpot is the best CRM. It's incredibly user friendly and always getting better. 10/10 would recommend."""
"""Hubspot serves well as a CRM, particularly for those looking to streamline their marketing, sales, and service processes in one platform. The distinction between its free and paid versions lies in the depth of features offered, with paid tiers providing more advanced tools and analytics capabilities. This scalability allows businesses of various sizes to find a suitable fit for their needs. I've had a fantastic time using this site for managing my projects and tasks. It's incredibly versatile and really helps in keeping everything organised, which, in a way, complements the CRM needs similar to what Hubspot aims to address."""
"""Agreed with this. Hubspot CRM is fine startups and small companies with minimal needs. But anyone looking to scale beyond that will start to hit a brick wall. Salesforce has a much wider range of scalability and customization. But many companies under let's say 20 employees would struggle to admin it unless they already have someone with Salesforce skills on the team."""
"""I have used this software and in my opinion compared to the tool from FIRMAO it is inferior. The software from FIRMAO has all the good tools that this type of software should have. Plus there is now a 14 day trial period."""

"""Too expensive!! I finally left after paying way too much for the 1 year contract. I went to Go High Level and it is 80% cheaper and actually does more that HS."""
"""Can anyone tell me how good Hubspot is at tracking activity and linking it to individual IP & email addresses? I am coming from the college admissions/marketing world. We are finding that open rates are unreliable because of bots. Are there systems that are better or worse at tracking and linking this kind of information?"""

"""I'm on the other side of some of the folks who have commented already. I'm a big time HubSpot fan boy. If it's in your budget, I think HubSpot is absolutely worth it. The CRM isn't going to be as robust as Salesforce, but for many companies that's a good thing. I think the website management tools are some of the best I've ever used. And having all of your sales and marketing analytics in one place provides an invaluable single view of the customer journey."""
"""HubSpot is good to offload security to rather than WP. It is much less flexible than WP but if security is important than the trade off is worth it"""
"""We looked at moving from SalesForce to HubSpot. The cost would have been 3x - 4x more expensive."""
"""Not good. Basic functions such as searching by customer number is only available in enterprise plan, which makes it unaffordable for small biz or NPO."""
"""This is a really helpful update. Those empty timelines always made intent signals feel less useful than they could be. Getting 30 days of activity right away will make scoring and segmentation a lot smoother for teams that rely on this data. I think this will save a lot of time for anyone who tracks accounts regularly."""
